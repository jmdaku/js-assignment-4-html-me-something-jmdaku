               2019</h1>
                  <p class="section">During the inspection process, we had learned that the sewer line connection had collapsed. The connection was located on that side of the house but the crew had trouble finding the pipe. By the time that they were finished, that side was almost entirely mud.

                  <p>We had a fence built soon after purchase and it included a large gate. We decided to construct a wide path and shade garden in that area to allow access to the rest of the yard and limit the accumulation of runoff rainwater. </p>

               <p class="section">In 2019, we completed the base of the path but only found half of the needed stepping stones. The intent was to search for more matching stones in the spring of 2020. </p>

               <p class="section">In early 2022, the old cherry tree that shaded part of that area needed to be chopped down. The area received far more sun afterwards and many plants needed to be moved.</p>
                  <img src="images/2022_B.jpg" />
                  <p>That year, we also noticed that the original path border rocks had settled and were no longer large enough to form a barrier between the rock path and mulched garden and the two kept mixing. </p>
